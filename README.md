# Hey!

## I am ...

- Former OIer, Undergraduate, focus on compilers (research & engineering).
- Applied Chemistry @ Harbin Institute of Technology
- Computer Science (Architecture) @ Institute of Computing Technology, CAS

Interests:

- Compiler IR design and applications, include:
  - Auto-Vectorization
  - Static Analysis
- Package Managers (graph theory), and ABI

## Working

Previously working on the open source RISC-V compiler backend, clang semantic analysis, scalar optimizations. 

Currently working for an auto-vectorization backend for some architecture, in LLVM (closed source). 

Also some experimental projects just played for fun, e.g.

- Nix language server
